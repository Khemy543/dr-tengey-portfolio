              <p>
                Whilst I am fully aware that there are several people who have similar gifts, anointing, potential, and educational qualifications and as me, I am persuaded nonetheless, beyond every doubt, that, I am uniquely different, that I possess a unique potential, that I have a unique gift, and that I have a unique distinct and well-carved out assignment to deliver to my generation. I believe that whereas any other person can do most of the things I do to some degree, there is no single human being on this planet who has been endowed with the same level and character of potential, gifts, talents, passion and anointing like me. 
                <br/>
                I believe there is a specific assignment that I have been designed, created and sent to the planet earth to deliver to my generation. I believe there is no human being on earth who has the same passion, drive, motivation, training, experience and preparation for life like me. Thus, if I fail to deliver my assignment, I will have robbed my generation of my unique input, which cannot be supplied in the same manner to the same degree like I would have done. Guided by this truism, I endeavour, every moment, to focus on my gift, my talent, my passion, and what I am convinced my life’s assignment is about. 
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-5 col-xl-4">
              <img src="./images/welcome2.jpeg" alt="welcome to my site" class="img-fluid rounded"/>
            </div>
          </div><br><br>
          <div class="row gy-5">
            <div class="col-lg-5 col-xl-4">
              <img src="./images/welcome2.jpeg" alt="welcome to my site" class="img-fluid rounded"/>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-8 text-center text-lg-start">
              <p>
                It is this conviction that gives me the passion, the energy, and the fuel that drives my life, dictating the things I spend my life and time on, books I read, acquaintances I strike, and appointments accept or turn down, battles I fight or back out of, posts I share on social media, and even what I do for money. It is this that gives me the boldness, the confidence and even the fulfilment in what I do. Whenever I am engaged in doing what I believe represents my life’s assignment, there is nothing like tiredness, boredom or depression. <br>

                Discovering my assignment has helped make my life very focused and simplified, making every action of mine intentional. I do not have to do several things; no need to dissipate my scare energy and resources on things that fall outside my assignment area. It allows me to get focused, develop greater capacity and acquire more competencies, and attain mastery in my area of assignment. I do not claim to know or be able to do many things. It also lets me know whose assistance I need to elicit. I don’t feel bad if I need to ask for assistance from someone in doing those things that I know fall outside the area of my strength. It makes a specialist in my area; it makes me respect other specialists, who, I don’t see as posing a threat to me, but rather a complementary resource to rely on when I need them.
            </p>
            </div>
          </div><br><br>
          <div class="row gy-5">
            <div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-8 text-center text-lg-start">
              <p>
                With the discovery that my life’s assignment has been well-carved out, I endeavour to achieve success. Success here is defined neither in the amount of money I make doing what I do, nor in comparison with what others are doing, but instead, how much of what I’m meant to do I am able to accomplish. With that being the case, I do not compete with others – they are running in their lane, fulfilling a different assignment for which they will be accountable to their Creator, which assignment determines the strengths they have, and the things they can do. Instead, I compete with myself – I run in my lane. I measure my success by how far or near I am from where my assignment should have got me to. <br><br>

                So, I challenge myself. I inspire myself. I encourage myself. I critique myself; I review my notes. I want to be better today than I was yesterday, regardless of how excellent yesterday was. I try to beat my past record; not to merely glory in them.

              <p>
                I love doing what I do; I don’t regret it. If people die and return to earth, when I do, I would love to do what I do currently. I am proud of it. I do it till I become a specialist in it. The name Samuel Tengey seems to be popping up anytime they are looking for someone to solve a problem in my area, and I keep being looked for by people from around the world, because, somehow, they get to hear about me, that I focus on what I do and attain mastery in it. That’s the way I receive speaking engagements, including international ones. <br><br>
                I do not do what I do fundamentally for me; I do it, because I have a conviction that this is what I have been designed and designated for. Yet, because I do it to the best of my ability, I get rewarded by people who believe they benefit from my gift. Even if you gave me the money in the entire vault of a central bank and ask me to stop doing what I do, I will ask you to keep your money, and I will keep pursuing my purpose and passion. 
            </p>

          </div><br><br>
          <div class="row gy-5">
            <div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-8 text-center text-lg-start">
              <p>
                The day I stop pursuing my purpose would be the day I die, even if I’m still living and breathing oxygen. I don’t really look to retiring from what I do. I hope to work till I drop. In the process, I identify individuals with similar gift and passion as me and empower them to do what I do. They will continue from where I will leave off. <br><br>
Purpose issues out meaning to life, so I pursue it with all that I am and all that I have. If these tenets resonate with you, then come with me on this exciting adventure, and explore with me.
