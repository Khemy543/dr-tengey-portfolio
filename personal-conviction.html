          <p>
            With the discovery that my life’s assignment has been well-carved out, I endeavour to achieve success. Success here is defined neither in the amount of money I make doing what I do, nor in comparison with what others are doing, but instead, how much of what I’m meant to do I am able to accomplish. With that being the case, I do not compete with others – they are running in their lane, fulfilling a different assignment for which they will be accountable to their Creator, which assignment determines the strengths they have, and the things they can do. Instead, I compete with myself – I run in my lane. I measure my success by how far or near I am from where my assignment should have got me to. <br><br>

            So, I challenge myself. I inspire myself. I encourage myself. I critique myself; I review my notes. I want to be better today than I was yesterday, regardless of how excellent yesterday was. I try to beat my past record; not to merely glory in them. <br><br>

            I love doing what I do; I don’t regret it. If people die and return to earth, when I do, I would love to do what I do currently. I am proud of it. I do it till I become a specialist in it. The name Samuel Tengey seems to be popping up anytime they are looking for someone to solve a problem in my area, and I keep being looked for by people from around the world, because, somehow, they get to hear about me, that I focus on what I do and attain mastery in it. That’s the way I receive speaking engagements, including international ones.
          </p>

          <p>

            I do not do what I do fundamentally for me; I do it, because I have a conviction that this is what I have been designed and designated for. Yet, because I do it to the best of my ability, I get rewarded by people who believe they benefit from my gift. Even if you gave me the money in the entire vault of a central bank and ask me to stop doing what I do, I will ask you to keep your money, and I will keep pursuing my purpose and passion. <br> <br>
            The day I stop pursuing my purpose would be the day I die, even if I’m still living and breathing oxygen. I don’t really look to retiring from what I do. I hope to work till I drop. In the process, I identify individuals with similar gift and passion as me and empower them to do what I do. They will continue from where I will leave off. <br><br>
            Purpose issues out meaning to life, so I pursue it with all that I am and all that I have. If these tenets resonate with you, then come with me on this exciting adventure, and explore with me.

Even if you gave me the money in the entire vault of a central bank and ask me to stop doing what I do, I will ask you to keep your money, and I will keep pursuing my purpose and passion. <br> <br>
                The day I stop pursuing my purpose would be the day I die, even if I’m still living and breathing oxygen. I don’t really look to retiring from what I do. I hope to work till I drop. In the process, I identify individuals with similar gift and passion as me and empower them to do what I do. They will continue from where I will leave off. <br><br>
                Purpose issues out meaning to life, so I pursue it with all that I am and all that I have. If these tenets resonate with you, then come with me on this exciting adventure, and explore with me.
